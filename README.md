PC Connect: Explore, Compare, and Collaborate
🌟 Project Overview
PC Connect is a project created in my free time to enhance the experience of interacting with computers, particularly in computer labs. This application allows computers to seamlessly connect, share their specifications, and compare key details such as GPU, CPU, battery life, and more.

Additionally, it includes a Global Chat feature to enable users to communicate with others in real-time. Whether you're exploring system stats or chatting about the latest tech trends, PC Connect is here to make your computer lab experience engaging and productive!
